## How ChatGPT Kicked Off an A.I. Arms Race

### The full article is available on the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/technology/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence.html)

Something I found interesting about the article is the way that ChatGPT was created out of a fear of competition in just 13 days. I think it's really impressive that they were able to launch something so quickly after changing plans, and even more so being able to handle the huge surge in popularity the site is experiencing. With nearly 5 million visits a day, OpenAI has to be operating at a loss to gather research and improve the models. Though, they found success in reaching a $10 billion deal with Microsoft. Something I wonder about is whether one of the top tech companies acquiring such a powerful model will have a big impact on how available it will be to users in the future.

## Comments 
**James Galbraith**: As you mentioned, the consequences of new tech giants turning their attention towards AI tools like ChatGPT are uncertain. I share one concern mentioned in the article: that companies, in the spirit of captalist competition, will neglect the risks inherent in creating AI models. Personally, I am concerned about powerful AI tools like ChatGPT being weaponized in some manner.
